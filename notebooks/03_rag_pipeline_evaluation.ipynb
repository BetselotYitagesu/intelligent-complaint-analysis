    "# Task 3: Building the RAG Core Logic and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This task focuses on developing the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining vector retrieval and language model generation to answer user questions based on customer complaint narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a retriever to fetch the most relevant complaint chunks from the vector database.\n",
    "- Design a prompt template to guide the language model for grounded, relevant answers.\n",
    "- Build the generator that produces answers using the retrieved context.\n",
    "- Combine retrieval and generation into a clean pipeline.\n",
    "- Perform qualitative evaluation by running representative questions and analyzing outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retriever**: Embed user query and retrieve top-k relevant complaint text chunks with metadata.\n",
    "2. **Prompt Engineering**: Use a prompt template instructing the LLM to answer only from the retrieved context.\n",
    "3. **Generator**: Send the prompt + context to a language model (LLM) and get the generated answer.\n",
    "4. **RAG Pipeline**: Wrap these into a single function returning the answer and supporting evidence.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Test the system with sample questions, document answers, retrieved sources, and quality scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modular Python source files:\n",
    "    - `retriever.py`\n",
    "    - `prompt_template.py`\n",
    "    - `generator.py`\n",
    "    - `rag_pipeline.py`\n",
    "- A Jupyter notebook `03_rag_pipeline_evaluation.ipynb` to demonstrate and qualitatively evaluate the system.\n"
